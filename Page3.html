				Brick breaker is a 2D game which I developed using Unity and the C# programming language. This particular game is a one player game which incorporates assets that are not difficult to utilise, for when it comes to gameplay. The assets that are used for the game are a paddle, a ball, bricks and outer walls which are boundaries. All of the assets can be distinguished by colour, as the colours of the assets are different. The main aim of the game is to ensure that you take out all of the bricks using the ball, by moving the paddle from side to side without missing the ball. Therefore, to ensure that you win the game, the ball must always come into contact with the paddle which you are controlling, by utilising the keyboard. In addition, the ball will be constantly moving and bouncing off the outer walls of the game which are the boundaries, which will make the game more challenging for when it comes to gameplay.

				Furthermore, I have also incorporated a boost mechanic to give the ball more speed and a paddle extension mechanic, so that the size of the paddle can extend in width. In order to activate the boost mechanic, the 'B' key must be pressed on the keyboard of a PC/laptop and for the paddle extension mechanic to be activated, you must press the 'E' key on the keyboard. As soon as the boost mechanic is activated, the ball gets a sudden surge of speed momentarily which makes the game more challenging to play. More so, the ball also moves in a different direction once the boost mechanic is activated, to prevent the ball from getting stuck in one position for a long period of time. When the paddle extension mechanic is activated, the paddle's size extends and once the ball then comes into contact with the paddle, the paddle shrinks to its original size.
