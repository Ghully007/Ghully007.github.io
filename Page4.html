				UFO is a 2D game which I developed by using Unity and the C# programming language efficiently. This game is a one player game which incorporates simple but effective assets, which are a UFO spaceship, asteroids and a space themed background. The aim of the game is to evade all of the asteroids that you encounter, for when it comes to gameplay. In addition, if you evade a certain number of asteroids while playing the game then you will win. More so, the background is a moving background which scrolls in order to make the game look more realistic, for when it comes to gameplay.

			As well as that, I have incorporated a power up within this game which enables the UFO spaceship to move at a faster rate for a certain period of time. Furthermore, the power up will only be activated if the UFO spaceship comes into contact and collides with the power up. The power up will also enable the game to be more challenging, as the UFO spaceship may be difficult to control while the power up is activated because you are moving at a faster rate, which increases the chances that the UFO spaceship will collide against an asteroid and get destroyed. To move the UFO spaceship, you hold down the space bar key on the keyboard of a PC/laptop to move the player game object up and down, for when it comes to playing the game effectively.
