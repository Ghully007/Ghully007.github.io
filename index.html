                    I am a full time special needs student currently studying BSc (Hons) Computer Games Technology, at Birmingham City University. I aspire to be a professional games developer and want to work for a reputable games development company in the future, having graduated from university with first class honours. More specifically, I would prefer to be a games programmer instead of a games designer, due to the fact that my games development expertise are more programming related rather than design related. Currently, I have been developing games using the C# programming language and also have a lot of experience, for when it comes to utilising the Unity game engine in order to develop games. Furthermore, in my spare time I develop games and also enjoy learning about various different programming languages such as C#, C++, HTML, CSS and Visual Basic (VB). In addition, I want to develop my programming knowledge further for when it comes to developing games in any programming language. Throughout this website, I will be demonstrating the many diverse games that I have developed using different programming languages, however the key programming languages that will be demonstrated are C# and C++.

                            <p>Pong is a 2D game that I developed by using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. This game is a 2 player game which incorporates assets that are simple but effective to utilise, for when it comes to gameplay. The assets of this game are two rectangular paddles on each side that represent player 1 and player 2, as they are both on opposing sides of the game. In addition, the main asset of the game is the ball which the players will use to score for when it comes to playing the game efficiently. The aim of the game is to beat the opposing player by scoring into their goal and if you reach a score of 30, then you win the game and therefore the opposing player loses.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/pong2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>In order to make this game more enjoyable to play with, I incorporated a speed mechanic for the ball and also for the paddles that the players control, in order to play the game. More specifically, each time the ball comes into contact with any of the two paddles, the speed of the ball will get incremented by 1 enabling the game to be more challenging for the players but also enabling the ball to move at a faster rate. In addition, each time the ball comes into contact with any of the two paddles, that paddle's speed also increases gradually whereas the opposing paddle's speed remains the same and will not change, due to the fact that the ball did not come into contact with that paddle. Thus, the speed mechanic for the paddles will give any of the players an advantage over the opposing player. Furthermore, I have also incorporated a boost mechanic within the game, which enables any of the players to add a certain amount of force to the ball, allowing the ball to move at a faster rate and in a different direction, which is a mechanic that can only be utilised once by pressing the 'B' key on the keyboard of a PC/laptop. More so, the speeds of both the ball and paddles get incremented by 1 which enables the speed of the assets to get faster gradually.</p>

                            <p>Brick breaker is a 2D game which I developed using Unity and the C# programming language. This particular game is a one player game which incorporates assets that are not difficult to utilise, for when it comes to gameplay. The assets that are used for the game are a paddle, a ball, bricks and outer walls which are boundaries. All of the assets can be distinguished by colour, as the colours of the assets are different. The main aim of the game is to ensure that you take out all of the bricks using the ball, by moving the paddle from side to side without missing the ball. Therefore, to ensure that you win the game, the ball must always come into contact with the paddle which you are controlling, by utilising the keyboard. In addition, the ball will be constantly moving and bouncing off the outer walls of the game which are the boundaries, which will make the game more challenging for when it comes to gameplay.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/break.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Furthermore, I have also incorporated a boost mechanic to give the ball more speed and a paddle extension mechanic, so that the size of the paddle can extend in width. In order to activate the boost mechanic, the 'B' key must be pressed on the keyboard of a PC/laptop and for the paddle extension mechanic to be activated, you must press the 'E' key on the keyboard. As soon as the boost mechanic is activated, the ball gets a sudden surge of speed momentarily which makes the game more challenging to play. More so, the ball also moves in a different direction once the boost mechanic is activated, to prevent the ball from getting stuck in one position for a long period of time. When the paddle extension mechanic is activated, the paddle's size extends and once the ball then comes into contact with the paddle, the paddle shrinks to its original size. When I accomplished the development of the game, I then exported the game as a web player game which can be played below.</p>

                            <p>UFO is a 2D game which I developed by using Unity and the C# programming language efficiently. This game is a one player game which incorporates simple but effective assets, which are a UFO spaceship, asteroids and a space themed background. The aim of the game is to evade all of the asteroids that you encounter, for when it comes to gameplay. In addition, if you evade a certain number of asteroids while playing the game then you will win. More so, the background is a moving background which scrolls in order to make the game look more realistic, for when it comes to gameplay.</p>

                            <p>As well as that, I have incorporated a power up within this game which enables the UFO spaceship to move at a faster rate for a certain period of time. Furthermore, the power up will only be activated if the UFO spaceship comes into contact and collides with the power up. The power up will also enable the game to be more challenging, as the UFO spaceship may be difficult to control while the power up is activated because you are moving at a faster rate, which increases the chances that the UFO spaceship will collide against an asteroid and get destroyed. To move the UFO spaceship, you hold down the space bar key on the keyboard of a PC/laptop to move the player game object up and down, for when it comes to playing the game effectively.</p>

                            <p>The maze is a 3D game which incorporates shapes as assets such as cuboids and spheres, which I used to develop this game. The aim of the game is to move the sphere, get through the maze and ensure that the sphere reaches the finishing square, without touching any of the green walls. If you move the sphere and touch the green walls, then the game will automatically restart and you will start the game from the very beginning. In addition, the green walls move to make the game more challenging, which will prevent you from reaching the finishing square. Some walls move from side to side and other walls expand from their original size and also then shrink back to their original size.</p>

This is the main reason I developed the game, as I wanted to make this game feel more realistic for when it comes to gameplay, which is why I also incorporated smartphone controls as well as keyboard controls. More specifically, for the smartphone controls I have incorporated an accelerometer which enables you to move and control the sphere by tilting the smartphone at different angles. In addition, the keyboard controls are W, A, S and D but also are the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys, which provides you with more flexibility when playing the game using the keyboard controls.</p>

                            <p>More so, I have also incorporated touch screen controls for when it comes to using a smartphone to play the game and also a game menu screen, before the game actually begins on the smartphone, as you can see below. The touch screen controls are used so that you can start the game from the game menu screen, so that you can restart the game from the very beginning without starting the game from the game menu screen again and so that you can return to the game menu screen from the actual gameplay. For the touch screen controls on the smartphone, you tap 'Play' on the game menu screen to start the game, you tap the screen simultaneously using two fingers from anywhere on the screen to restart the game and you tap 'Home' when playing the game, to return to the game menu screen before the game actually begins.</p>

                            <p>Aerial Combat is a 2D game which I developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. In addition, this game was also one of my first year projects which I had achieved a first class in. Furthermore, the theme of this game is more related to World War 2 and specifically incorporates aerial combat, hence the name 'Aerial Combat'. The keyboard controls for this game are A and D to move the player plane left and right, F to fire bullets and R to fire missiles. As well as that, I have also incorporated Xbox 360 controls so that you are able to plug in an Xbox 360 controller into a PC/laptop via USB cable, allowing you to have an even more effective gaming experience. The Xbox 360 controls are the left joystick to move the player plane left and right, the RT button to fire bullets and the X button to fire missiles.</p>

                            <p>The aim of this game is to destroy enemy planes, bombers and missiles, by firing bullets and missiles of your own. In addition, this game incorporates four different waves of enemies, whereby each wave has a different number of enemies so the earlier waves have fewer enemies than the later waves. For each enemy you destroy you gain a score of 10 points and if you gain a score of 150 or more, without being destroyed yourself then you win the game. In addition, you have 3 lives and each time you get hit by either an enemy plane, bomber or missile, your lives get deducted. Then when your lives reach 0 you are destroyed and the game is over.</p>

                            <p>In this game I have also incorporated a power up mechanic and a firing cooling down mechanic. The power up mechanic enables you to fire missiles as well as bullets once collected, otherwise you will not be able to fire missiles and you will only be able to fire bullets. Furthermore, the firing cooling down mechanic is a system which prevents you from over firing your bullets when you have fired too many bullets, so therefore you must wait until your weapon has cooled down before you carry on firing more bullets.</p>
