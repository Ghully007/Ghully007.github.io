			Hello, my name is Ghulaam Ellahi and I am a full time special needs student currently studying BSc (Hons) Computer Games Technology, at Birmingham City University. I aspire to be a professional games developer and want to work for a reputable games development company in the future, having graduated from university with first class honours. More specifically, I would prefer to be a games programmer instead of a games designer, due to the fact that my games development expertise are more programming related rather than design related. Currently, I have been developing games using the C# programming language and also have a lot of experience, for when it comes to utilising the Unity game engine in order to develop games. Furthermore, in my spare time I develop games and also enjoy learning about various different programming languages such as C#, C++, HTML, CSS and Visual Basic (VB). In addition, I want to develop my programming knowledge further for when it comes to developing games in any programming language. Throughout this website, I will be demonstrating the many diverse games that I have developed using different programming languages, however the key programming languages that will be demonstrated are C# and C++.
